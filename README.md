# COVID19 DETECTION USING X-RAY IMAGES

![alt text](https://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/images/1466-chest-xray-ai-technology.jpg)


## Problem Statement:

There are a total of 26Cr Covid positive cases worldwide and is increasing. Performing Covid test requires blood samples and nose swab samples which can be expensive, time consuming and uncomfortable for many of the patients. 

## Proposed Solution:

A possible solution would be to create a Deep Learning model which would predict if the person is infected by covid19 by analysing an AP(anteroposterior) view of his/her chest X-Ray image.

## Data Description:

Dataset available in kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/elikplim/concrete-compressive-strength-data-set)

Data Characteristics:
The Dataset contains images of Positive and Negative chest X-Ray images in AP view.
